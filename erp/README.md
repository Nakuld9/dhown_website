# Integrated Textile Manufacturing ERP

A production-grade ERP for an integrated knitting, dyeing and finishing textile
company, built around a **correct double-entry accounting engine** with Indian
GST support, full traceability from sales order to general ledger, and a
specified (pending-verification) Color Service dispensing integration.

> **Scope honesty.** The brief describes a product a team builds over many
> months. This repository delivers **Stages 1–4 plus the accounting core
> (Stage 6)** as working, tested, database-backed code — architecture, the full
> data-model foundation, auth/RBAC, the double-entry engine + trial balance, the
> procurement→knitting→greige→dyeing→dispensing→consumption chain, FIFO
> inventory, and a **Color Service simulator** — plus the four design documents.
> Still pending (specified in `docs/`): financial statements (P&L/Balance
> Sheet/Cash Flow), banking/reconciliation, GST return preparation, management
> dashboards, finishing/quality, and the Next.js UI. Nothing here claims GST
> filing, bank feeds or **live** Color Service integration are production-ready —
> the dispensing integration runs against a simulator pending vendor
> verification.

## What works today (verified by tests)

**Accounting core**
- **Double-entry posting engine** — balanced-only posting, one-sided lines,
  Decimal money (no floats), idempotent `posting_reference`, atomic commit.
- **Immutable ledger** — posted vouchers/lines cannot be edited or deleted
  (enforced at the ORM session level); corrections via reversal vouchers.
- **Chart of accounts** — full textile COA seeded, configurable & hierarchical;
  **configurable posting rules** map each business event to accounts.
- **Accounting periods** (Indian FY, closed-period locks), **14 voucher types**,
  gap-free numbering, **trial balance** + **account ledger** drill-down.
- **Financial statements** (Stage 7) — **Profit & Loss**, **Balance Sheet**
  (balances by construction, folding current-year profit into equity),
  **Cash Flow** (operating/investing/financing, ledger-derived), and **debtor /
  creditor ageing** (FIFO allocation) — all derived from the posted ledger.
- **Indian GST** (Stage 7) — **sales & purchase registers**, **GSTR-1** summary
  (B2B/B2C, rate-wise, HSN-wise), **GSTR-3B** summary (outward tax, eligible
  ITC, net payable), and a **books-vs-registers reconciliation**; rates come
  from configurable tax codes, never hardcoded.
- **Banking** (Stage 7) — customer receipt / supplier payment / contra / bank
  charge postings, **CSV bank-statement import** (idempotent), and **bank
  reconciliation** (auto-match by amount + date, outstanding/in-transit items,
  difference explained).

**Operations (Stage 2–4)**
- **Procurement** — chemical/dye GRN → FIFO stock layer + GST purchase voucher.
- **FIFO perpetual inventory** — costed receipts/consumption; stock sub-ledger
  reconciles with the GL control accounts.
- **Knitting** — yarn issue (FIFO) → traceable greige rolls + WIP/greige postings.
- **Recipe scaling** — %OWF / grams-per-kg (250 kg × 1.4% = 3.5 kg), approved
  versions only.
- **Dyeing** — batches/baths with roll traceability and the approved recipe.
- **Color Service** — dose-order builder, **simulator** adapter, idempotent
  ingest → immutable dispensing transactions → **consume stock exactly once** →
  Dr WIP / Cr inventory; **correction dosing** as separate transactions;
  **reconnect/replay never duplicates**; per-bath **consumption register**
  (recipe vs actual, variance, cost, per-kg).
- **Sales** — GST sales invoice posting (receivable + output tax).

- **Stock vs GL reconciliation** (TEST 17) — per control account, perpetual
  **value-based** FIFO inventory valuation vs the general-ledger balance, with
  per-account differences and an `is_reconciled` flag; ties to the paisa.
- **Report exports** (Stage 9) — one-call **Excel (.xlsx)** and **PDF** export
  for trial balance, P&L, Balance Sheet, cash flow, debtor/creditor ageing, GST
  sales/purchase registers, GSTR-3B, and the dye-bath consumption register
  (one report-document model renders to both formats).

- **Finishing & quality** (Stage 8) — finishing transactions (hydro/slitting/
  drying/stenter/compacting/raising/heat-setting) with shrinkage and roll
  finishing; **quality inspection** auto-graded from Delta E + shade match →
  accept/rework/reject (updates roll status); **customer complaints** with
  resolution; and a quality summary (rejection rate, avg Delta E, open
  complaints).
- **Management dashboards** (Stage 8) — Owner (revenue, gross/net profit, cash &
  bank, receivables, payables, inventory value, sales trend), Factory (knitting/
  dyeing output, active batches, chemical cost), Accounts (today's receipts/
  payments, bank balances, debtors/creditors, GST payable, TB status), and
  Chemical (dye/chemical cost, top consumption, stock alerts, dispensing errors).
- **Web UI** — a self-contained React SPA (dark-navy sidebar, KPI cards, Recharts
  charts) served at **`/app/`**: four dashboards; **transaction entry** —
  Purchase (GRN), Sales invoice, and a guided Dyeing flow (batch → bath →
  simulate dispensing → live consumption register) that drives the real posting
  engine and Color Service simulator; master management (customers, suppliers,
  warehouses); a **Quality & Finishing** page; and authenticated Excel/PDF report
  downloads. No build step and no runtime CDN — libraries are vendored and the
  JSX is precompiled.

**Platform** — JWT auth + RBAC (15 roles), REST API, Alembic migrations,
idempotent seed + demo data, Docker Compose.

`78 passing tests` cover the accounting invariants, the nine worked posting
examples, correction dosing, RBAC, full-cycle trial balance, procurement,
knitting, recipe scaling, the full dispensing cycle, end-to-end traceability,
the financial statements (P&L / Balance Sheet / Cash Flow / ageing), GST
(registers / GSTR-1 / GSTR-3B / reconciliation), and the
REST flow. See the acceptance-test map below.

## Design documents (start here)

| Doc | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Modular-monolith design, module map, posting engine, integrity rules |
| [`docs/ER_DIAGRAM.md`](docs/ER_DIAGRAM.md) | Mermaid ER diagrams + the master traceability chain |
| [`docs/ACCOUNTING_POSTING_MATRIX.md`](docs/ACCOUNTING_POSTING_MATRIX.md) | Dr/Cr rules for every business event |
| [`docs/COLOR_SERVICE_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/COLOR_SERVICE_INTEGRATION.md) | Dispensing integration spec, adapters, simulator |

## Quick start

### Option A — Docker (Postgres + API)
```bash
cd erp
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env      # then edit SECRET_KEY / admin password
docker compose up --build
# API:  http://localhost:8000      Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```
The API container waits for Postgres, runs migrations, seeds the demo company
and admin user, then serves.

### Option B — Local (SQLite, no server)
```bash
cd erp/backend
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./erp.db" SECRET_KEY="dev-secret-$(python -c 'import secrets;print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
alembic upgrade head
python -m app.seed.seed
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then open the **web UI** at **http://localhost:8000/app/** and sign in with the
seeded admin (below). The dashboards show data once the demo/manufacturing data
is present (tests seed it; for a live DB, create documents via the API/UI).

### Run the tests
```bash
cd erp/backend && . .venv/bin/activate && pytest
```

### Rebuild the UI assets (only if you change `app.src.jsx`)
```bash
cd erp/frontend && ./build-ui.sh   # needs npm; re-vendors libs + recompiles app.js
```

### First login
Seeded superuser: **`admin` / `admin123`** (override via `ERP_ADMIN_*` env vars;
change it immediately outside dev).
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -d 'username=admin&password=admin123' | python -m json.tool
```
